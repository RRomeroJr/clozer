save.py line 1061
check = os.system("cp llama.cpp/build/bin/llama-* llama.cpp")
doing some linux specific commands to move files
Also A little below that
check = os.system("rm -rf llama.cpp/build")

replaced with equivilants using shutil

--

those commands are looking for llama exe-s in the bin folder but
my setup atleast has them in a bin/Release folder
for file in glob.glob("llama.cpp/build/bin/**/llama-*", recursive=True)
now trying recursively to look look for files in the bin folder
and any sub-dirs

# command = f"./{quantize_location} {full_precision_location} "\
            #     f"{final_location} {quant_method} {n_cpus}"

This is by subprocess.Popen which seemly runs the process in cmd
and not in power shell.

I could have checked for windows then said to run powershell but This
felt cleaner

 quantize_location = os.path.normpath("/" + quantize_location)
            command = f".{quantize_location} {full_precision_location} "\
                f"{final_location} {quant_method} {n_cpus}"
